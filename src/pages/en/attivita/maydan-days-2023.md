The Maydan study days, organized in collaboration with SeSaMO, the Department of Cultures, Politics and Society of the University of Turin, and the University of Bologna, are the first in-person event promoted by the journal.

The initiative is conceived as a shared training space for undergraduates, graduates, and PhD students, in which to discuss their research projects and learn under guidance how to transform them into academic articles.
Particular attention is dedicated to building a sustainable writing path, collective revision, and presenting one's work in scientific contexts.

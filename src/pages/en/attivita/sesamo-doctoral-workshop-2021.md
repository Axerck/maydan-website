The roundtable, aimed at PhD students and organized by Maydan, is part of the Online Doctoral Workshop 2021 promoted by SeSaMO and the Department of Political and Social Sciences of the University of Bologna.

The activity creates a space for discussion on the most recurring problems that emerge during the doctorate: research obstacles, logistical and institutional difficulties, academic isolation, time management, and expectations.
Through dialogue between PhD students and more advanced scholars, possible strategies to address these knots are discussed.

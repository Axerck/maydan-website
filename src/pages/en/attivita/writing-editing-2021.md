The seminar cycle, organized with Professors Daniela Pioppi and Antonia Soriente (University “L’Orientale”) and with the patronage of SeSaMO, is aimed at students and PhD candidates interested in improving their academic writing.

The meetings introduce the main phases of editing and provide methodological tools for drafting articles, bibliographic reviews, and book reviews.
Forms of scientific dissemination and ways to make research results more accessible without sacrificing precision are also discussed.

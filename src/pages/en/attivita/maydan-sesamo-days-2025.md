The Maydan and SeSaMO study days are the third major in-person event organized by the journal and aimed at undergraduates, graduates, and PhD students.
The initiative is designed to support young scholars entering the world of research, creating a space for discussion on both the content of their work and the practical aspects of academic writing.

During the days, we work on how to transform a project into an article, how to present it in academic contexts, and how to develop critical and technical skills useful for a research career.

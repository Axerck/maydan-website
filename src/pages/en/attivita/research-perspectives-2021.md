The seminar, organized in collaboration with Professor Matteo Legrenzi (Ca’ Foscari University of Venice), is primarily aimed at PhD students and master's graduates dealing with the Middle East.

The meeting explores job opportunities available in Italy and abroad for those researching the region, discussing academic paths, competitive calls, international mobility, and extra-academic outlets.
The goal is to help young scholars orient themselves in building a sustainable professional path, in dialogue with their own research questions.

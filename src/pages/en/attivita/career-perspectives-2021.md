The seminar, organized in collaboration with Professor Luca D’Anna (University of Naples “L’Orientale”), is aimed at undergraduates and graduates studying the Middle East.

The meeting maps some possible career trajectories in different fields – media, international cooperation, security – showing how the skills gained in studies on Arab and Islamic worlds can translate into concrete professional opportunities.
The goal is to offer realistic orientation tools to those who are in the transition phase between education and work.

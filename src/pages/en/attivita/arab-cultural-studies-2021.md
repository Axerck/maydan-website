within the framework of the 2021–2022 cycle of "SeSaMO Webinars on Research and the Middle East", Maydan organized a roundtable dedicated to fieldwork in Arab cultural studies.

With interventions by Elena Chiti and Teresa Pepe, we reflect on the concrete practices of ethnographic and documentary work in contemporary Arab contexts.
The discussion focuses on both methodological aspects, ethical questions, and security problems involving researchers in the field.

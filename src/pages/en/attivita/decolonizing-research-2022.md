In this meeting, we attempted to address in radical terms the question of decolonizing research processes and the field, giving space to reflection on the criticalities that inhabit research practices. What does it actually mean to practice and think research by decolonizing the process and the knowledge we build and produce through it? What difficulties, tensions, intellectual and practical discomforts emerge? How do we face them and how do we reconceptualize research practices in light of these criticalities? Interacting with the experiences of our guests Malaka Shwaikh and Caterina Boldoni, we talked about positionality and positioning, human, social and material relations, and languages and translation in the processes of knowledge construction and production.

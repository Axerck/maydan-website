The Maydan and SeSaMO study days, organized together with the Italian Society for Middle Eastern Studies and the ISO Department of Sapienza University of Rome, represent the second in-person appointment promoted by the journal.

The main objective is to support young scholars in building their research path: from theoretical questions to writing, up to the public presentation of results.
The work focuses on both the content of the projects and the technical skills required for drafting and reviewing a scientific article.

<Layout title="About Us - Maydan Journal">
	<div class="text-justify">
		<p>
			Maydan is the first Italian journal of Arab, Semitic, and Islamic
			studies directed by PhD candidates, graduates, and undergraduates.
			founded in Autumn 2020 by Alessia D’Accardio Berlinguer, Antonio
			Pacifico, Luigi Sausa, and Pietro Menghini. Its main purpose is to
			encourage the production of first research articles by young
			scholars.
		</p>
		<p>
			This platform serves as a continuous training path involving both
			authors and editors, encouraging reflection on research and the
			development of skills necessary for the production, editing, and
			dissemination of scientific articles. In this way, Maydan aims to
			support the entry of young scholars into the world of research and
			foster contacts and dialogue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Maydan revolves around a broad vision of Arab, Semitic, and Islamic
			worlds that includes the geographical areas of the Middle East and
			North Africa, the Sahel regions, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and
			Southeast Asia. Maydan also gives space to contributions regarding
			the connections of these geographical areas with Europe, North
			America, and the rest of the world. The journal proposes, in fact,
			to deepen the presence and experiences of Arab, Semitic, and Islamic
			worlds even outside regions traditionally characterized as "Arab" or
			"Muslim" and to highlight the internal differences within these
			worlds. In accordance with this critical perspective, Maydan also
			welcomes analyses aimed at researching the links and relationships
			between these areas and other communities and political, economic,
			social, and cultural dynamics that traverse the globalized world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, the journal invites critical reflection on the concept
			of Area Studies and the problematization of notions and culturalist
			approaches that reiterate an essentialist and fundamentally colonial
			vision of Arab, Semitic, and Islamic worlds. Maydan therefore
			appreciates proposals capable of deconstructing the gaze and
			methodologies of research and elaborating original methods and
			questions. Alongside the analysis and problematization of restricted
			and culturalist notions often widespread in Area Studies, the
			journal welcomes with interest research approaches that look at the
			dynamics of interconnection and interdependence between different
			contexts. All this is fundamental in Maydan's vision both to grasp
			the specificities of the worlds, dynamics, and historical moments
			analyzed within it, and to extract them from an "exceptionalist"
			definition.
		</p>
		<p>
			Maydan is an annual publication. Submitted articles undergo a
			double-blind peer review process which also involves, when
			necessary, the assistance of an international scientific committee,
			consisting of professors from various disciplines. Accepted
			languages are Italian, English, and French, to favor the
			international profile and dissemination of the journal.
		</p>
		<p>
			The journal accepts contributions from PhD candidates, graduates,
			and undergraduates from foreign and Italian universities.
